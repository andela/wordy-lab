##Wordy Lab

###Step 1

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test
at a time.

###Step 2

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

###Step 3

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

> What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

> What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?

> What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?

###Step 4

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 times 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

> What is 78 plus 5 minus 3?

> What is 18 times 3 plus 16?

> What is 4 times 3 divided by 6?

> What is 4 plus 3 times 2?

###Extensions

Implement questions of the type:

> What is 2 raised to the 5th power?

Remember to write failing tests for this code.


###How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\wordy-tests.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


###Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning, and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
